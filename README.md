# AI-enabled-home-and-task-assistant
I have developed an AI enable home and computer automation system. Which identify people near doors and notify using face recognition, controlling light and electrical equipment. Also control computer system with voice command. 
I have edited it such a way that it can be used in your computer as personal assistant. 
In the repository there is a file named dataIntent.jason. You can add your question in 'patterns' and answer in 'responses'. This file is used to train our neural network in the project. It had many patterns and responses but i have removed so that you can run it in your computer.
You need to install these packages in your system before running appMain.py. The package can be install using ' pip install packages_name'. And packages are 'pyaudio,speech_recognition, pyttsx3, wikipedia, webbrowser, ecapture, wolframalpha' 
If you want the fully version of my porject feel free to contact me and we can develop the system as you need it.
